# Legendary
BigParse, a Legend in his own mind. Second cousin twice removed to rapper BigPun. Lives life way to seriously. Judges people and things prematurely and quite extensively (rather than observing reality to see how it is in actuality) and therefore is wrong frequently. Sometimes tragically. He hurts those closest to him. Leaping to strike at their preoffered vulnerability like some kind of emotional vampire, their emotions shattering, masses of fragile loving interpersonal +karmic bonds torn usunderas if a bull in the china shop of their hapless hearts. The universe eagerly rewarding him, earning -karma with a quadratic multiplier. Ye, far in excess of the act in isolation. 


Always quick to emotion, you can count on BigParse to lose his cool, before having _any_ of the facts, and self-righteously assumes the worst about those closest to him.  Can often be seen ranting at people more intelligent than himself about how they believe the wrong things and how his way is vastly superior despite his perspective birthing his 'ways' causing innumerable hardships for himself when inevitably manifested corporeally. Hardships he refuses to acknowledge responsibility for and which he is subjected to continually like some greek mythological sisyphus. Convinced of his own greatness.
